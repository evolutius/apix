# Continuous Deployment for Version Management

Continuous Deployment (CD) is an essential practice in modern software development that allows you to automate your deployment process, ensuring new versions are rolled out quickly and consistently. This guide will help you set up Continuous Deployment for API-X servers using TeamCity, integrating version management and automated updates whenever changes are pushed to your code repository.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CD for API-X with TeamCity, ensure you have the following:

- A TeamCity server installed and configured. You can refer to [TeamCity's official installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/documentation/#Installation) for setup instructions.
- A GitHub repository containing your API-X server code.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your build agents, if you plan to use containerized deployments.
- Basic familiarity with Git, TeamCity, and Docker.

## Step 1: Set Up a TeamCity Project

1. **Create a New Project**: Log in to TeamCity and create a new project.
2. **Connect to Version Control**: Connect your project to the GitHub repository where your API-X server code is hosted.
   - Navigate to the **Version Control Settings** of your new project.
   - Add a new VCS root by selecting **Git** and providing the necessary details, such as the repository URL and authentication token.

## Step 2: Define a Build Configuration

A build configuration in TeamCity defines the steps required to build and deploy your application.

1. **Add Build Steps**:
   - **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
     - Add a build step to install the dependencies for your API-X server.
     - Choose **Command Line** as the runner type and use the following command:
       ```sh
       npm install
       ```
   - **Step 2: Run Tests**
     - Add a step to run tests to ensure the code is working correctly before deployment.
     - Again, use the **Command Line** runner with:
       ```sh
       npm test
       ```
   - **Step 3: Build Docker Image (Optional)**
     - If you are using Docker, add a step to build a Docker image of your API-X server.
     - Use the **Docker** runner or **Command Line** with:
       ```sh
       docker build -t yourdockerhubusername/apix:latest .
       ```

2. **Add Version Tagging (Optional)**:
   - You can add a step to tag the version in your Git repository.
   - Use a **Command Line** runner with:
     ```sh
     git tag -a v%build.number% -m "Tagging version %build.number%"
     git push origin v%build.number%
     ```

## Step 3: Deploy Automatically with Docker Compose

To deploy the API-X server automatically after a successful build:

1. **Add Deployment Step**:
   - **Step 4: Deploy with Docker Compose**
     - Create a deployment script that uses Docker Compose to start or update your API-X server.
     - Add a new build step to execute the following command:
       ```sh
       docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
       ```

2. **Update NGINX Configuration** (if necessary):
   - If new instances are added or removed, update your NGINX configuration to reflect these changes.
   - This can be automated as part of the deployment script, depending on your setup.

## Step 4: Set Up Triggers for Continuous Deployment

To make your deployment process fully automated:

1. **Add a VCS Trigger**:
   - Go to the **Triggers** tab in your build configuration.
   - Add a **VCS Trigger** to automatically start a new build whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
2. **Optional: Add Scheduled Triggers**:
   - If you prefer scheduled deployments, you can set up a **Scheduled Trigger** to deploy changes at a specific time.

## Step 5: Monitor Builds and Deployments

TeamCity provides a build history and detailed logs for each build. Use these features to:

- **Monitor Build Status**: Check if your builds are successful or if any steps fail.
- **View Logs**: Debug any issues by reviewing the logs generated during each step of the build and deployment process.
- **Rollback if Necessary**: If a deployment fails, you can manually trigger a build with a previous version tag to roll back to a stable state.

## Conclusion

Using TeamCity to implement Continuous Deployment for your API-X server allows you to streamline the deployment process and ensure consistency across different environments. By integrating CI/CD with Docker and NGINX, you can automate version management, build new versions, and deploy them seamlessly. This not only reduces the risk of manual errors but also ensures a faster and more reliable deployment cycle.

For more advanced CI/CD setups, including integration with Kubernetes or other orchestration tools, refer to the [Load Balancing Between Multiple Hosts guide](./Load_Balancing_Between_Multiple_Hosts.md).
